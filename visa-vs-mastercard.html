However, Visa and Mastercard are far and away the largest credit card networks in operation today, with both brands offering three different tiers of credit cards through their partnerships with banks, travel companies and other organizations.</p><p>Both Visa and Mastercard are also unique from Amex and Discover in the fact they do not offer any credit cards of their own as Amex and Discover do. In fact, Visa and Mastercard only extend credit cards through co-branded relationships with banks such as Barclays, Capital One, and Chase. Both Visa and Mastercard also offer co-branded credit cards in conjunction with retailers and travel providers, including airlines and hotels.</p><h2 id=key-differences-between-visa-and-mastercard>Key differences between Visa and Mastercard</h2><p>If you're looking for a new credit card and wondering whether you should get a Visa or a Mastercard, you should know that neither type is inherently better than the other. For the most part, you'll want to look at specific credit card benefits, perks, and rewards offered by cards you're considering before you apply.</p><h3>Key points</h3><ul><li>Visa and Mastercard do not issue any credit cards of their own, but they are two of the largest payment networks for credit cards along with American Express and Discover.</li><li>Credit cards emblazoned with the Visa and Mastercard logos can be secured credit cards, cash back credit cards, travel credit cards, and more.</li><li>If you're choosing between a Visa and a Mastercard, you should know their functionality and acceptance worldwide is nearly identical. With that in mind, you can find the <a rel=alternate href=#>best credit card</a> for your needs based on the features, perks, and rewards you want the most.</li></ul><h2 id=visa-vs-mastercard-key-similarities>Visa vs. Mastercard: Key similarities</h2><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 bQCais not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 hkFKev"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 hGTrVQ" readability=35><tr class=table-row readability=4><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Worldwide acceptance</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Accepted in 200 countries and territories worldwide</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Accepted in 210 countries and territories worldwide</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=4><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Zero liability for fraud</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Comes standard with Visa credit cards</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Comes standard with Mastercard credit cards</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=12><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Generous perks and benefits</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Cards may offer travel insurance benefits, roadside assistance, purchase protection, and more</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Cards may offer travel insurance benefits, roadside assistance, cellphone protection, and more</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Worldwide acceptance</h3><p>If you're looking at Mastercard and Visa credit cards with the goal of choosing a card with the widest acceptance worldwide, you should know these two types of credit cards have a nearly identical global footprint.</p><p>According to Visa, cards issued through its payment network are accepted in 200 countries and territories around the world. Meanwhile, Mastercard reports acceptance in 210 countries and territories around the world. Most of these destinations overlap; there is no substantive difference in where you can use these cards worldwide. Visa also shares updated statistics about card usage, including the fact there are currently more than 4.2 billion Visa credit cards in circulation today.</p><h3>Zero-liability-for-fraud protection</h3><p>Both Visa and Mastercard offer the protection of zero liability for fraud on their card products. This means cardholders have $0 in financial liability if a thief uses their credit card or their card number to make purchases without their consent. This benefit is generous, but it's not much better than the federal protections afforded to credit card users when it comes to fraudulent purchases.</p><p>In fact, the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> reports that federal law caps consumer liability for fraudulent purchases on credit cards at $50, and that's only if the card is reported lost or stolen after someone uses it.</p><h3>Generous perks and benefits</h3><p>Both Mastercard and Visa offer credit cards that come with a range of important benefits and consumer protections. For example, some Visa and Mastercard products offer payment network benefits like cellphone insurance, travel accident insurance, or trip cancellation and interruption insurance.</p><p>That said, it's worth noting that not all Visa or Mastercard credit cards offer the same selection of benefits. Card issuers (e.g. Chase, Capital One, etc.) can pick and choose which benefits come with different card products and also offer separate benefits of their own.</p><p>Ultimately, this means you'll want to compare credit cards from both networks and their specific offers before you choose a credit card.</p><h2 id=visa-and-mastercard-key-differences>Visa and Mastercard: Key differences</h2><p>Because Visa and Mastercard have nearly identical global acceptance records, it rarely makes sense to pick one type of card over the other based on where you can use it. The only real differences between Visa and Mastercard are the features and rewards individual cards offer.</p><p>Both payment networks extend three different tiers of credit cards that are geared to users with different credit profiles. For example, Mastercard offers Standard, World Mastercard, and World Elite Mastercard products. Meanwhile, Visa credit cards can be Visa Traditional cards, Visa Signature credit cards, or Visa Infinite cards.</p><p>What's interesting about the three card tiers from each of these payment networks is that individual card issuers can discern which perks apply with individual cards and which ones don't. This is another reason you'll want to scrutinizel the fine print and card terms to make sure you get a card with the benefits you want.</p><h3>Mastercard: Standard, World, and World Elite</h3><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 bQCais not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 hkFKev"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 hGTrVQ" readability=31.5><tr class=table-row readability=2><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Mastercard ID Theft Protection; Mastercard Zero Liability Protection; Mastercard Global Service</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=8><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=7><p>Standard Mastercard benefits; Lyft credits; DoorDash benefits; ShopRunner membership; Priceless Experiences; Mastercard Golf; Complimentary professional travel services; Mastercard Hotel Stay Guarantee; Lowest Hotel Rate Guarantee; Mastercard luxury hotel and resorts portfolio; Free nights, car, RV, air; Mastercard airport concierge</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=3><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>World Elite</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4.5><p>World Mastercard benefits; Fandango credits; World Elite concierge; Cellphone protection; Additional discounts and promotions</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Visa: Standard, Visa Signature, and Visa Infinite</h3><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 bQCais not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 hkFKev"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 hGTrVQ" readability=32><tr class=table-row readability=3><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4.5><p>Lost or stolen card reporting; Emergency card replacement; Dovly Uplift; ID navigator; Zero liability for fraud; Roadside dispatch</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=5><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Visa Signature</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Standard Visa benefits; Shipt benefits; Travel and emergency assistance services; Visa Signature rental car privileges; Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection;; Extended warranties; Lost luggage reimbursement; Trip delay reimbursement; Auto rental collision damage waiver; Global Entry or TSA PreCheck statement credit; Trip cancellation and interruption insurance; Hotel theft protection; Travel accident insurance; Baggage delay reimbursement; Cellphone protection; Price protection; Purchase security; Return protection</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=6><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Visa Infinite</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=6><p>Visa Signature benefits; Visa Infinite rental car privileges; Priority Pass Select airport lounge access; Airline incidentals statement credit;; Visa Infinite Experiences; Additional travel insurance benefits, including: emergency medical and dental protection and emergency evacuation and transportation coverage</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=examples-of-best-visa-cards--benefits>Examples of best Visa cards & benefits</h2><p>Some of the best credit cards available today are <a rel=alternate href=#>Visa credit cards</a>, although the benefits and rewards they offer vary considerably.

Instead, compare all credit cards based on the features you can benefit fromâ€”whether you're after a <a rel=alternate href=#>travel credit card</a>, a cash back credit card, or a <a rel=alternate href=#>balance transfer credit card</a> that lets you consolidate and pay down debt at 0% APR for a limited time.</p><p>Our advice? Take the time to check your credit score to see where you stand, then compare all the available credit cards you have the potential to qualify for from American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa. Side-by-side comparisons will give you the best idea of which cards would benefit you the most.</p><h2 id=time-stamp-choose-the-best-credit-card-for-your-needs-regardless-of-the-payment-network>TIME Stamp: Choose the best credit card for your needs regardless of the payment network</h2><p>Visa and Mastercard credit cards offer some overlapping benefits, but most cardholder perks you want probably come from the card issuer itself. This means you'll want to compare cards that operate on all payment networks, as well as options from card issuers such as Capital One, Chase, Citi, and Wells Fargo.</p><p>At the end of the day, the payment network on which your card operates is almost inconsequential. Your credit card's perks, features, and rewards will impact you the most.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faq>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2><h3>Does Chase have Visa or Mastercard?</h3><p>Chase offers Visa credit cards as well as Mastercard cards. For example, the Chase Freedom UnlimitedÂ® credit card is a Visa credit card, while the Chase Freedom Flex is a Mastercard.</p><h3>Does Capital One have Visa or Mastercard?</h3><p>Capital One offers both Visa and Mastercard products. The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card and the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card are both Visa cards, whereas most other Capital One credit cards operate on the Mastercard network.</p><h3>Does Citi have Visa or Mastercard?</h3><p>Citi also issues both Mastercard and Visa card products. For example, the Costco Anywhere VisaÂ® Credit Card by Citi and the Costco Anywhere VisaÂ® Business Credit Card by Citi are both Visa credit cards. The rest of Citi's card offerings operate on the Mastercard payment network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8t7XSmmSvq12irrTAxKuamqqUZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvisa-vs-mastercard.html&text=Visa%20vs.%20Mastercard%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvisa-vs-mastercard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvisa-vs-mastercard.html&title=Visa%20vs.%20Mastercard%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvisa-vs-mastercard.html&title=Visa%20vs.%20Mastercard%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvisa-vs-mastercard.html&title=Visa%20vs.%20Mastercard%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvisa-vs-mastercard.html&description=Visa%20vs.%20Mastercard%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Difference%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-tourist-netflix-what-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why 'The Tourist' Should Be Your Next Netflix Binge">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./un-guide-des-bonnes-pratiques-et-de-nouveaux-seuils-pour-bien-debuter-lannee.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Un &amp;quot;Guide des bonnes pratiques&amp;quot; et de nouveaux seuils pour bien dbuter l'anne">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
