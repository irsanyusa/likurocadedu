It’s only when you’re planning a&nbsp;<a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> that you realize how important the shoes are too. After all, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;long ceremony where you not only have to&nbsp;look amazing, but also feel comfortable. Some celebrities like Yoko went for 100% comfortable by&nbsp;wearing sneakers to&nbsp;their weddings, some others prefer classic stilettos no&nbsp;matter what. In&nbsp;any case, they all looked amazing.</p><p>So&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;see how some of&nbsp;the most famous women in&nbsp;the world combined style and comfort in&nbsp;their wedding shoes. We&nbsp;can tell you for sure: there are very smart solutions, and there are also some other women on&nbsp;the list that ditched comfort for looks. After all, it’s their wedding, they have to&nbsp;look and feel amazing!</p><p><h2>1. Pippa Middleton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ac/dd5/875236578ebfb829bf373d9308.jpg><p>In&nbsp;May 2017, Duchess Kate Middleton’s younger sister <a href=#>married</a> businessman James Matthews. For this special occasion, she chose to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;lace <a href=# title=dress data-link=tag>dress</a> from Giles Deacon, which she <a href=#>combined</a> with a&nbsp;custom pair of&nbsp;satin shoes from famous designer Manolo Blahnik’s bridal collection. The <a href=# title=silk data-link=tag>silk</a> satin pump has a&nbsp;pointed toe, ankle strap, and Swarovski crystal buckle embellishment. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=#>estimated</a> that the shoes alone were valued at&nbsp;approximately $2,500&nbsp;at the time. But hey, a&nbsp;wedding is&nbsp;the most important day of&nbsp;your life and the shoes were amazing!</p><p><h2>2. Kate Moss</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9a/4c0/60346f50da858f0882ba5eeb45.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2011, British model <a href=# title="Kate Moss" data-link=tag>Kate Moss</a> and rock star Jamie Hince walked down the aisle as&nbsp;husband and wife. Kate <a href=#>chose</a> a&nbsp;vintage dress made by&nbsp;designer John Galliano. Still, it’s worth mentioning that it&nbsp;wasn’t the dress that caught everyone’s attention, but Moss’ shoes. Manolo Blahnik, the designer, was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;attending to&nbsp;every single request the model made until the shoes were perfect according to&nbsp;her. Blahnik <a href=#>confessed</a>, saying, “We&nbsp;did them 5&nbsp;times to&nbsp;get them the way she wanted. The shoes arrived the day before and there were too many jewels on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=heel data-link=tag>heel</a> because of&nbsp;the long train, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;had women working up&nbsp;until midnight to&nbsp;change&nbsp;it.” The result was a&nbsp;Godiche style sandal loaded with stones that made a&nbsp;perfect duo with the dress.</p><p><h2>3. Princess Diana of&nbsp;Wales</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/76b/1ae/01f9c05993a4f79ad8b4b458bf.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the summer of&nbsp;1981, Diana, who was only 20&nbsp;years old, <a href=#>married</a> Prince Charles of&nbsp;England. This wedding was dreamy from beginning to&nbsp;end, and the dress worn by&nbsp;the Princess of&nbsp;Wales was second to&nbsp;none. On&nbsp;her walk through St. Paul’s Cathedral she wore a&nbsp;<a href=#>Victorian</a> dress from the designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel. To&nbsp;accompany this great work of&nbsp;art, shoemaker Clive Shilton was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;creating shoes worthy of&nbsp;royalty and he&nbsp;had approximately 6&nbsp;months to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this.</p><p>The <a href=#>shoes</a> were low-heeled, to&nbsp;dissimulate the Princess’s high stature, and they were covered with 542 sequins and 132&nbsp;pearls. To&nbsp;decorate the upper part, the princess chose a&nbsp;heart-shaped brooch. The sole was covered with suede fabric to&nbsp;avoid tripping, and on&nbsp;the arch part, it&nbsp;had details and flowers painted by&nbsp;hand, plus a&nbsp;secret detail on&nbsp;the sole: the initials of&nbsp;the royal couple as&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;their everlasting love.</p><p><h2>4. Yoko Ono</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/79c/705/024c935a0d83cc814a50fa7294.jpg><p>Without high heels or&nbsp;strappy sandals: that’s how Yoko Ono <a href=#>married</a> one of&nbsp;the members and leaders of&nbsp;the highly acclaimed band The Beatles. It&nbsp;was the year 1969, and back then no&nbsp;major fashion expert would ever dream of&nbsp;putting their bets on&nbsp;flat shoes for brides. Yoko, however, never really thought that was a&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;change her peculiar sense of&nbsp;fashion. She chose a&nbsp;<a href=#>pair</a> of&nbsp;Superga sneakers that were bright white. She combined them with matching socks that reached her knee and a&nbsp;miniskirt in&nbsp;the same color. Today, the Superga brand is&nbsp;worn by&nbsp;many singers, actresses, models, and even royalty, but Yoko remains the trendsetter who wore Superga to&nbsp;her own wedding.</p><p><h2>5. Grace Kelly</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16e/b8f/0ede5b55669c5bbf9a815f673d.jpg><p>The American-Irish <a href=#>actress</a> became a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;Monaco’s Royal family when she married Prince Rainier III. For such an&nbsp;important occasion, she decided to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;<a href=#>dress</a> made by&nbsp;designer Helen Rose, which she combined with a&nbsp;<a href=#>pair of&nbsp;David Evins’ shoes</a>. They were white, classic salon shoes, with rounded tips and a&nbsp;2-inch heel.</p><p>The main feature of&nbsp;this shoe model was the lace that outlines the lace trim. It&nbsp;came with a&nbsp;rosette at&nbsp;the top, which was decorated with pearls and glass beads. But here’s a&nbsp;detail that not many people were aware of&nbsp;back in&nbsp;the day. Grace asked for a&nbsp;copper <a href=#>penny</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;encased into the right shoe for good luck. That was her way to&nbsp;honor some of&nbsp;her ancient Irish beliefs. Today, both the dress and the shoes that the actress wore are on&nbsp;display at&nbsp;the Philadelphia Museum of&nbsp;Art.</p><p><h2>6. Queen Letizia of&nbsp;Spain</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/957/86b/f38c8a50d88da3e11e50746318.jpg><p>Letizia went from being a&nbsp;journalist to&nbsp;becoming the queen of&nbsp;Spain. Clearly, her life took a&nbsp;new turn on&nbsp;her <a href=#>wedding</a> day to&nbsp;the now King Philip VI&nbsp;of&nbsp;Spain. For such an&nbsp;important occasion, she wore a&nbsp;natural silk dress with fine embroidery, <a href=#>designed</a> by&nbsp;Manuel Pertegaz. The dress had a&nbsp;train that was almost 17&nbsp;feet long. The heels, created by&nbsp;Pura López, were about 4&nbsp;in&nbsp;high and made of&nbsp;the same fabric as&nbsp;the dress. They had openwork fabric on&nbsp;one side and a&nbsp;small teardrop-shaped tongue with a&nbsp;bow-shaped detail on&nbsp;the instep.</p><p><h2>7. Princess Victoria of&nbsp;Sweden</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d45/d8d/10578559a8ad8d763c8daea919.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2010, Princess Victoria of&nbsp;Sweden <a href=#>wore</a> a&nbsp;wedding dress made by&nbsp;Swedish designer Pär Engsheden. Her shoes, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;distinctive mark of&nbsp;Roger Vivier’s brand, had a&nbsp;buckle <a href=#>covered</a> with rhinestones and were lined with the same fabric as&nbsp;the dress. On&nbsp;behalf of&nbsp;Roger Vivier, who also created the shoes worn by&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;at her coronation, Bruno Frisoni admitted to&nbsp;feeling “privileged that the relation between the Maison Roger Vivier and Royalty endures with such glamour and elegance.” And it’s no&nbsp;wonder, who wouldn’t?</p><p><h2>8. Hailey Baldwin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d49/99e/7a744f582fa7ec7ada30090bf6.jpg><p>The model walked down the aisle with famous Canadian singer Justin Bieber. During the <a href=# title=party data-link=tag>party</a> that took place after the wedding, she wore an&nbsp;ivory-colored miniskirt with bare shoulders. Her attire was <a href=#>designed</a> by&nbsp;Vivienne Westwood and was worn together with a&nbsp;custom-made pair of&nbsp;Jimmy Choo heels. Baldwin decided to&nbsp;wear these shoes as&nbsp;well during the wedding. Interestingly enough, even if&nbsp;the shoe’s design was a&nbsp;true classic, the specific model she was wearing <a href=#>had</a> 2&nbsp;tulle bows that simulated a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;oversized bows on&nbsp;the ankle strap, very similar to&nbsp;the <a href=#>Aveline 100</a>.</p><p><h2>9. Kate Middleton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/019/c8c/a1882c584e8a823eed5fd07e79.jpg><p>Few details have been revealed about Kate and William’s <a href=#>wedding</a> in&nbsp;2011. There was so&nbsp;much secrecy around the whole ceremony that it&nbsp;took about 4&nbsp;years after the wedding for the shoes that the duchess wore to&nbsp;be&nbsp;revealed. They were traditional ivory satin heels with<a href=#> hand-embroidered</a> lace made by&nbsp;the Royal School of&nbsp;Dress. Sarah Burton from Alexander McQueen, the same fashion house that made the wedding dress, was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;the final design of&nbsp;the shoes. Together with the wedding dress, these were <a href=#>exhibited</a> at&nbsp;Buckingham Palace.</p><p><h2>10. Chiara Ferragni</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60b/56e/00c6a05e1ca857bcf260be644a.jpg><p>The expectations regarding everything this famous Italian designer would wear during her wedding were sky-high. And she did not disappoint. Everything turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more than perfect. Ferragni wore <a href=#>3</a><a href=#>&nbsp;different outfits</a>. The <a href=#>shoes she wore</a> were created by&nbsp;Dior’s artistic director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, with a&nbsp;heel of&nbsp;just 2.5 inches and a&nbsp;ribbon with the bride’s name embroidered on&nbsp;it. “Each letter is&nbsp;an&nbsp;individual accessory, so&nbsp;each one was created in&nbsp;a&nbsp;unique way and then assembled,” <a href=#>confessed</a> one of&nbsp;the designers of&nbsp;the shoes. In&nbsp;addition, they used antique gold and a&nbsp;black diamond that Maria Grazia requested especially for this occasion. To&nbsp;make Chiara Ferragni feel more comfortable during the whole event, the shoe brand also created <a href=#>flat shoes</a> for her to&nbsp;change into.</p><p><h2>11. Princess Madeleine of&nbsp;Sweden</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/09b/b2f/78654a556f80e1f2b4f7bb8553.jpg><p>With her characteristic elegant touch, Princess Madeleine of&nbsp;Sweden wore an&nbsp;organza dress that was <a href=#>made</a> by&nbsp;prestigious designer Valentino Garavani, especially for her wedding day. She combined this beautiful lace dress with a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;pointed stiletto heels created by&nbsp;the exclusive designer Oscar de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Renta. The shoes had sheer layers with small matching dots and a&nbsp;discreet ribbon to&nbsp;secure the ankle.</p><p><h2>12. Beatrice Borromeo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/370/b93/d79fca57aa93902aed595a1df8.jpg><p>Known as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most fashionable couples among European royals, Beatrice and Pierre Casiraghi had not one, not&nbsp;2, but <a href=#>5&nbsp;different outfits</a> for the entire wedding celebration that included the reception and the party. The princess wore dresses made by&nbsp;Italian designers Valentino and Giorgio Armani. But the outfit that really stole the show and caught fashionistas attention was a&nbsp;Greek-inspired white tulle Armani dress. It&nbsp;stood out with a&nbsp;modern touch: daring metallic <a href=#>sandals</a> with intertwined straps, an&nbsp;accessory that has rarely been seen at&nbsp;classic royal weddings.</p><p><h2>13. Olivia Palermo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b51/994/aafb0a5854847d650ef12ad894.jpg><p>This bride dazzled everyone with a&nbsp;3-piece <a href=#>dress</a> designed by&nbsp;Carolina Herrera. However, the part of&nbsp;her attire that really garnered most of&nbsp;the attention was her shoes. In&nbsp;keeping with the tradition of&nbsp;wearing something blue for good luck, Olivia <a href=#>wore</a> the same iconic heels we&nbsp;saw in&nbsp;the Sex and the City wedding: the cobalt blue Manolo Blahnik stilettos decorated with a&nbsp;rhinestone buckle on&nbsp;the front.</p><p><h2>14. Charlotte Casiraghi</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a6/05f/72676e53b9b76508f1240cd314.jpg><p>Another royal bride worth noting was Charlotte Casiraghi. For her religious ceremony, she wore a&nbsp;low-cut Chanel dress and walked down the aisle <a href=#>wearing</a> an&nbsp;unexpected pair of&nbsp;white slingback pointed heels that were closed in&nbsp;the front. The intention was to&nbsp;imitate a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;boots, originally from Chanel’s haute couture collection.</p><p>So, tell&nbsp;us, are you more into comfy wedding shoes, or&nbsp;are you all about the look?
