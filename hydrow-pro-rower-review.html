But thanks to Cincinnati’s unpredictable weather, cardio, and generally full body workouts, can be a struggle. One day it’s pouring rain, the next it’s 100 degrees, and just a few months later the wind chill is below zero.</p><p>So, when I had the opportunity to try the Hydrow Rower, widely regarded as one of the sleekest, most efficient and high-performing home rowers on the market, I was excited to get my heart rate up a bit more often. It’s quiet, and is set up like the Peloton of rowers—with a large TV screen and membership program allowing you to compete with rowers around the world. Here’s how it went.</p><p><h3 class=title>Hydrow Rower - Personal At-Home Interactive Rowing Machine With 22" HD Touchscreen, WiFi & Bluetooth Connectivity - Silver & Black</h3></p><h2 id=what-is-the-hydrow-pro-rower>What is the Hydrow Pro Rower?</h2><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Hydrow</a> is a magnetic rowing machine, meaning it uses magnets to simulate the resistance of the water. There are other types as well, including air-based resistance; these are the two most popular. The magnets create electric currents that produce resistance. The Hydrow has a <a rel=nofollow href=#>membership-based program</a> where you can engage in workouts with instructors on the screen who film on real bodies of water around the world. The membership also comes with other types of workouts and an app, so you can still exercise when you’re away from your Hydrow rower but have access to another kind. You can also work out without the membership, but the experience isn’t close to as exciting.</p><h2 id=unboxing-and-set-up>Unboxing and set up</h2><p>Get ready for a really big box to show up at your house. Big enough that my five kids could fit in it and play house before it headed for recycling. This is something to prepare for, because you might need to create a path and make sure the box can fit wherever it’s headed before the delivery. You can pay to set it up if you want, or set it up yourself. It isn’t a super complicated assembly process, and has clear directions, but you might consider getting some help based on the sheer size of the box.</p><p>Luckily, once the machine is out, it doesn’t take up nearly as much space. In fact, it’s a sleek—and dare I call a machine even sexy—design that makes you feel like you’re on a top-notch product. The assembly crew spent around thirty minutes building the product, so it might be smart to allot an hour for set up if you DIY it.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/44417fde7bac44686daaf331673dca5b/76902/sideview.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><p>Upon starting the computer/TV screen, I was prompted to enter my subscription code. This was simple, and led me to a screen where I set up my profile, including my name that would be on display in the rowing competition boards against others. I tried “Rowmama,” but of course, it was taken by the other rowing mamas out there. So I had to deal with it.</p><p>My only issue with the technology is that the initial update was exceptionally slow—around 20 minutes in all—which was a bit frustrating when you’re ready to jump on and get to work. So, just like when Zoom wants to update when you’re about to get on a call, do it another time, if possible.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/9a0257ab9fb522130600935397922160/76902/membership-helpful-to-have.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/30e8bd5d1c337f724e11d6ca19d94b70/76902/making-your-profile-name-and-easy-onboarding.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/6acc509212dbaff49fa5dc69a237ac62/76902/option-to-row-on-your-own-no-membership.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><h2 id=hydrow-pro-rower-pros-and-cons>Hydrow Pro Rower pros and cons</h2><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li>Setup and assembly was easy—30 minutes or less</li><li>Pairs easily with Apple products to monitor heart rate and other metrics</li><li>Love the scenery of the workouts, filmed on real bodies of water around the world</li><li>Quiet and seamless movement</li><li>Intuitive screen setup/technology</li><li>Easy-to-use foot pads with straps, and a moveable heel system</li><li>Excellent touchscreen with high-quality images</li><li>Motivating instructors</li><li>Ergonomically designed handle that doesn’t slip when sweaty</li><li>Rubber supports on the feet so the machine doesn’t move</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li>Consumers aren’t impressed with the membership. They feel it’s expensive and the content isn’t as impressive as it sounds. Some even wish they could just watch Netflix while rowing instead of being locked in to the Membership program content.</li><li>Others have shared frustration with shipping and setup not being timely — inquire about wait time when you purchase.</li><li>Slow updating process</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><h2 id=hydrow-pro-rower-price>Hydrow Pro Rower price</h2><p>The price is far and away the most substantial barrier to many rowing enthusiasts and beginners alike from accessing this product. The <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hydrow Pro Rower</a> is $2,195 and financing is available through Klarna.</p><p>But also, consumers will likely want to have the budget to continue with the membership for the long haul—at $44 per month.</p><p><h3 class=title>Hydrow Rower - Personal At-Home Interactive Rowing Machine With 22" HD Touchscreen, WiFi & Bluetooth Connectivity - Silver & Black</h3></p><h2 id=hydrow-pro-rower-specifications>Hydrow Pro Rower specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 145 pounds</li><li><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 375 pounds</li><li><strong>Height limit:</strong> Fits up to a 36-inch inseam</li><li><strong>Electrical:</strong> 120-volt standard outlet</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> 22-inch HD touchscreen with front-facing speakers and full HD resolution</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Aluminum and steel frame; polyester webbing for quiet operation</li></ul><h2 id=the-hydrow-pro-rower-is-it-for-you>The Hydrow Pro Rower: Is it for you?</h2><p>When I first got on the rower, I found it to be comfortable, and felt my body was well aligned to perform this type of exercise. I appreciated all of the adjustable features, from foot straps to resistance. If you’re a beginner looking for guidance on how to get into rowing, the videos by level are a great place to learn. If you’re more advanced, you’ll appreciate the small things that matter, such as the exceptionally quiet machine, the smooth rowing motion, and the “real” workouts with multiple views of the instructor’s form being modeled.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/d8f2e6b14f6521a9f64c6470fe7e3ea3/76902/example-course-starting-screen.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><p>The rower might not be for you if you’re looking to do a quick bit of cardio in the middle of another workout. You could use a cheaper machine for that, as this is best for rowers who want to do a full workout of just rowing.</p><p>If you don’t have enough space to leave the heavy machine where you set it up, you might want to look to other rowers that can stand up for storage purposes. This one does not. But, you can purchase a <a rel=nofollow href=#>storage kit</a> separately.</p><p>Finally, if you’re on a budget or aren’t sure you’ll want to keep up with the nearly $50 monthly membership, you might want to try another rower—after all, how many Pelotons have you seen end up on second-hand markets after membership prices went up? This has the potential for a similar issue.</p><h2 id=the-hydrow-pro-rower-is-it-worth-it>The Hydrow Pro Rower: Is it worth it?</h2><p>Yes, the rower is worth the investment if you can swing it. It provides a full body workout that will diversify your exercise routine, and motivating programs that help you push yourself. It helps you push past your personal bests, but also others you compete against. The additional programs beyond rowing make it more worth it than if it were just rowing videos.</p><h2 id=hydrow-pro-rower-performance>Hydrow Pro Rower performance</h2><h3>Dimensions and storability</h3><p>The Hydrow Pro Rower has the following specifications:</p><ul><li><strong>Overall dimensions:</strong> 86 inches (length) x 25 inches (width) x 47 inches (height)</li><li><strong>Dimensions when stored:</strong> 25 inches (width) x 33 inches (depth) x 86 inches (height). Note that an upright storage kit is required for vertical storage. This is sold separately.</li></ul><h3>Ease of use/user friendliness</h3><p>They say you get what you pay for, and in this case it’s absolutely true. The process is completely intuitive—you could really be close to a beginner and figure out how to jump on and row without much background knowledge. The program on the screen is simple to use, and would even be accessible to those who don’t find themselves to be very tech savvy.</p><p>The adjustability of many aspects of the machine help make it accessible and user-friendly to a wide variety of people.</p><h3>Interface</h3><p>The Hydrow Pro Rower connects through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (10 mbps is recommended). Additionally, the Membership app can sync to Strava or Apple Health. You can choose the genre of music the machine plays, connect your <a rel=alternate href=#>headphones</a> for a quieter ride (ideal if you are sneaking in a workout during your kid’s naptime), and even adjust the balance of the instructor’s voice to the music to hear better.</p><h3>Exercise formats</h3><p>You can enhance your Hydrow Pro Rower experience by becoming a member. The Hydrow Membership program provides live rowing workouts and more than 5000 rowing workout videos. Additionally, the membership gives access to mobility, yoga, pilates, and strength training.</p><p>The overall cost for the membership is $44 per month. If you thrive on competition, membership is a must because you compete live against others, and your stats are compiled on your dashboard so you can track your progress over time, too.</p><p>While the company explains that the Hydrow Pro Rower is best used with a membership, you can continue to use the equipment if you choose not to purchase a membership. The Just Row function of the rower does not have workout videos included but does provide on-screen workout metrics, a Bluetooth connection for heart rate monitors, and adjustable resistance and drag settings.</p><h3>Programs</h3><p>There are extensive options when it comes to programming. For example, the assessment workout is a five-minute workout to assess your rowing progress. The Training Camp is a six-week program to “kick off a new season with strength and positivity,” Hydrow promises. You can participate in weekly challenges with people competing within the membership program as well through Hydrow racing.</p><p>Videos are flexible schedule-wise because you can come at a certain time to a live workout. When I work out with others, even virtually around the world, I find it more motivating than a recorded workout, though sometimes those are also necessary when you can’t make a live one.</p><p><h3 class=title>Hydrow Rower - Personal At-Home Interactive Rowing Machine With 22" HD Touchscreen, WiFi & Bluetooth Connectivity - Silver & Black</h3></p><h2 id=hydrow-pro-rower-quality>Hydrow Pro Rower quality</h2><h3>Motion control</h3><p>There are a few key considerations when you shop for a rower, and this one ticks all the boxes in terms of quality. You want a rower that will stand its ground — quite literally — while you’re riding it, without adding any additional motion such as rocking and sliding, or jarring you during your workout. There are no issues with the Hydrow in those regards.</p><h3>Sound control</h3><p>You also want a quiet, smooth ride. While some rowers are much louder, this type is nearly silent, which is excellent so you don’t have competing noises between the machine, music, and instructor. Unless you drop the bar, you won’t hear much noise, just the swishing water as you virtually row with the instructor.</p><h3>Positioning</h3><p>There is a distinct feature I love with this rower involving a small, but essential body part for rowing — the heels. On some rowers, the entire foot pedal moves, or none of it at all, changing how similar the machine is to riding in an actual boat. But this machine allows for just your heel to move, while keeping the ball of your foot stable. It makes for a specific feeling in which you and the rower are one, rather than you trying to move the machine. My only critique in regards to the position is the bumps/shape of the seat itself didn’t feel completely natural to me, though everyone’s butt is different!</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/1fc1f98c1780596411e96c0788e8d7fa/76902/heel-positioning-feature-position-1.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><h3>Handlebars</h3><p>The handlebars are more important than you might think when you row. I don’t know if I’m just weird, but my hands like to sweat in a serious workout, so that can prove to be challenging using machines largely based on grabbing a handlebar, like rowing. But for this machine, there was no slipping, having to stop to readjust grip, or similar issues. It has an ergonomic design and anti-slip properties, which was helpful.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/b262286586cd669718c6f4888b4903f2/76902/handlebar-style.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/545bb70adbbf9cf8af4167eab6e1b30f/76902/showing-steps-of-the-rowing-motion.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/75c5897e5fa938b842a2fd079b3b7a66/76902/showing-steps-of-the-rowing-motion-1.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/6b54257f3dbc8581e9be9dd3ff4db645/76902/foot-straps-adjustable.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/6fde7fdd2db02ea8583826d772b4f40a/76902/foot-straps.jpg></span></span><p>ALEXANDRA FROST</p><h2 id=hydrow-pro-rower-warranty>Hydrow Pro Rower warranty</h2><p>One-year limited warranty at no extra cost.</p><h2 id=hydrow-pro-rower-returns>Hydrow Pro Rower returns</h2><p>All Hydrow rowers come with a 30-day trial.

One additional benefit compared to other exercises like running or <a rel=alternate href=#>ellipticals</a> is that you don’t have to stand to do it — which can be a game changer for many people, such as those with foot injuries.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Cleveland Clinic</a> shares that rowing has four basic motions: the catch, the drive, the finish, and the recovery. So while it seems like one motion, it’s four in a seamless and fluid pattern. They add that it’s a low-impact way to burn calories, improve range of motion and joint strength, reduce stress, and other benefits.</p><h3>Is the membership worth it?</h3><p>Yes, the membership is an essential feature that will keep you coming back to the rower for more. If you skip this step, you can still use the machine, but without the stunning views of bodies of water around the world, and access to some high-quality instruction and sweaty competition.</p><h3>Who is a rower good for?</h3><p>The rower is good for beginners and serious athletes alike. It’s best for those able to invest in their rowing machine and keep up with it in the long run.</p><h3>Is rowing difficult to learn?</h3><p>Rowing isn’t difficult to try, but if you are new, you can work through some of the programming teaching you the finer points, such as engaging your core.
