In psychology this is called repetition compulsion, and it essentially means you're trying to fix the past by pursuing similar situations or people who once hurt you.</p><p>There are several signs that you haven't let go of the past, and these can manifest in how you behave with your current partner. Often, these patterns can start incredibly early with the relationships you had with your parents growing up.</p><p>"Our childhood experiences with our parents and our teachers and our friends really do have a pretty big impact on how we operate both personally and professionally in early adulthood," Jennifer B. Rhodes, a psychologist, dating coach, and founder of <a href=# id=7fee3efa-fddb-3c44-ae95-71c6f805292c>Rapport Relationships</a> , told Business Insider.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"There's a pretty big population of people who enter early adulthood who have insecurity around creating and managing relationships. So I think what happens is when you're not fully aware of the patterns you experienced at a younger age, you actually reenact those as an adult and sometimes it doesn't look pretty in your personal or your professional life."</p><p>We spoke to several relationship experts to find out how to tell if you're still hanging on to your past, and how this affects your current relationship.</p><p>Here are the 11 signs they came up with:</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>1. You always attract the same type of people</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/iTfktktTURBXy8wNDJlODQ2Yy0zZGNmLTQ0MWMtOGI2Mi01Mzc2MDJlN2NmMjkucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>According to Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and author of " <a href=# id=4f60e7ac-8ff8-384a-add4-f43e5859cb99>The Empath's Survival Guide: Life Strategies for Sensitive People</a> ," if one of your parents was a narcissist, or an alcoholic, you may find you keep being attracted to these types of people until you can work through what hurt you in that initial relationship and begin to heal.</p><p>" <a href=# id=8a12cf4c-7dec-39f4-ac97-63dda97a4f71>Empaths do this a lot</a> , because they're such fixers and they want to get in there and heal things," she told Business Insider. "And they think if they fix the person, somehow that's going to heal their original relationship. But it never works.</p><p>"So it's important that people are aware, if they've had alcoholic parents and they keep attracting alcoholic boyfriends, that there may be a connection there, and that it's important to look into whatever wounds you had growing up with an alcoholic parent so you don't keep creating that in your life."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>2.

These are things or experiences that were once important to you, or that you used to enjoy, but because they are connected to your previous partner you can't stand them anymore.</p><p>"Or you feel guilty for enjoying it, or revisiting the same thing re-traumatises you," she said. "Re-trauma can be something normal, but having it persist for a long time is not normal. There's a big distinction. There's always this period of healing where you get this dip and after that you get a rise. But if you feel like you're always going to be in this dip forever, then that's not healthy."</p><p>Tainted pleasures can be something as simple as a musician or a place. It could even be an item of clothing.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I can't wear this dress, not because he bought it for me, but because he said something nice about it or I wore it to something," Neo said. "So sometimes there's this guilt that you're betraying your ex-partner, and sometimes you just feel like it's been tainted."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>3.

Neo said people can have sexual hangups around their previous relationships for various reasons.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"For instance, when people feel they cannot be sexually intimate because of their ex-partner," she said. "We're not just talking about general sex, but also certain positions, or certain ways in which a person touches them, or how they see themselves sensually Really importantly, a big sign is if you say to yourself 'I'm not going to think about it.' But if it still owns you emotionally, in the middle of the night, or if you're triggered or stressed, then it still affects you."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-26>4.

Or did I wait, hoping it would go away, until it got so bad it caused a row between us?" she said. "Resentment is often a potential flashpoint. Lack of communication about plans, that's also often a problem... I think communication is a key issue."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-33>5.

People have emotional buttons, she said, and this could be anything that upsets them words, a tone of voice, or shaming and these are where your wounds are.</p><p>"Because if the wounds aren't there, someone can say something to you that's irritating but it won't get to you to the degree it does when it's not healed," she said. "So it's important to look at what your emotional buttons are. Do you feel shamed? Do you feel criticised? Do you feel not seen? And whatever they are to just gently and compassionately look at them, and begin to heal them.</p><p>"It's good to enlist your mate in the process if they are open to that, so say this is what I'm doing with my life and I just want to be able to love you even more. I want us to be closer. It's really wonderful when you have two people who are on board with that."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-39>6.

This anxiety makes things worse for people in all interpersonal relationships, she said, and one of the main reasons for it could be because people didn't have good role models as a child.</p><p>"You tend to take things more personally, and more impulsively react, causing a lot of conflict in all kinds of relationships," she said. "The natural reaction to anxiety is avoidance, and so unless you had really good models of people who are emotionally secure, and open, and can communicate, it's actually a skill that has to be learned, and I'm seeing it's taking people a lot longer to get to a place where they realise they have to learn that skill."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-44>7.

"But if you think carefully and think about whose voice is this really, you'll realise actually it's not your voice. You've just taken it on. It could be your father's, or your ex-partner's... This voice makes you question and judge yourself, especially because of what he or she told you in the past, and it affects your behaviour."</p><p>Essentially, it is like the past keeping you in a box, she said. And part of breaking out of that box is realising your past relationship has no control over you anymore.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-50>8.

Some people experience this so vividly, it's like re-living the trauma, said Neo.</p><p>"Re-living means that when you forget then is not now, and you're not in your present situation," she said. "You can smell it, feel it, and it becomes so vivid."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Many of her clients experience nightmares too, such as their ex running after them with a cleaver. This is especially common after an abusive relationship, because the abuser has been blown up in their mind.</p><p>"In our heads, these things have an infinite space to fester, so this person can feel like a monster," Neo said. "If this person still seems to hold a lot of power over you, I ask you 'can you actually shrink this person in your head, in this visualisation?' If not, they still hold power over you."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-57>9.

Neo said this is like "looking out for the psychopath behind every bush."</p><p>"With trauma comes this inability to trust life," she said. "There are good people and there are going to be bad situations that bring out the worst in people. But then you've got to come out of the paranoia where you're always looking over your shoulder."</p><p>If you're with your partner, or your friends, and you're always looking out for that time where they're going to trip you up, it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, she added. In other words, by being too paranoid, you might doom your relationships before they begin.</p><p>"It's about learning to trust your gut," Neo said. "And we often try to trust our heads too much, but the thing is our heads can justify anything. So when you find yourself justifying too much about a person I call it cognitive Photoshop that's when you know your head is getting a bit caught up in this crazy hamster wheel."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-64>10.

"Whenever a break-up happens, whether a bad one or an amicable one, it usually leads to emotional drain. You are parting from someone you loved and someone you spent a lot of time with, so you will need to take some time to readjust and re-learn to be yourself, without the other person in the equation. Taking this time to learn about yourself and reflect on your relationship can do a lot to help the next relationship be a success."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-84>Remember not everyone is the same</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-16df0954-17a6-4846-a331-5256b9d12d78 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/kYQktktTURBXy9iZWJkNGRjZC02NDkzLTQxN2UtYTIyOS04YjNjZDNlNTBlODcucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>nd3000/Shutterstock</p><p>"Just because someone has hurt you in the past, it doesn't mean that your new partner will do the same, and it definitely doesn't mean that you should punish them for the mistakes made in your previous relationship," Brud added.</p><p>It's also important to communicate with your new partner, be open and honest, and explain why you might have certain hangups or sore spots.</p><p>"If you know that you have been irrational in a given situation, explain why you behaved that way," he said.
