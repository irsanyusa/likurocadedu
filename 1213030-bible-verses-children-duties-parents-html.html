God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</i></li><li>Hebrews 11:20: <i>By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.</i></li><li>Titus 2:3-5: <i>Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine.

Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those who are truly widows.</i></li><li>1 Timothy 2:1-15: <i>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing. Therefore we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring. This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering.</i></li><li>Colossians 3:20-21: <i>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.</i></li><li>Romans 12:17-21: <i>Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</i></li><li>Romans 7:2: <i>For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage.</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/52cf9e0ba5e554c7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian graduate turns to akara frying business after years of unemployment, hopes to succeed</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The problem of our time is that children, just like many parents, are completely unfamiliar with God’s, Biblical principles of proper family relationships.
