Smoking wasn’t that cool anymore—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rates had plummeted among U.S. adults and teens</a>—but then came Juul, a sleek, addictive product with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flashy advertising tactics</a> that took off like wildfire. It soon became clear that e-cigarettes were hooking teens who otherwise wouldn’t have gone near nicotine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Juul is out</a> and Zyn is in. It’s even more discreet than Juul, with no plumes of vapor. A user simply tucks a small pouch of nicotine, additives, and flavorings under their lip for up to an hour. Over that time, it releases a steady hit of nicotine—more than that in a cigarette, but delivered much more slowly. Like Juul, it contains no tobacco.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You're not alone if you're just hearing of Zyn, but it's been for sale in the U.S. since 2014. Like other products that launched around that time, including Juul, it entered the market when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had few regulations for new tobacco and nicotine products. The agency retroactively required these brands to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prove they benefit public health enough to stay on the market</a>, and Zyn's manufacturer has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filed those applications</a>, but the FDA hasn't reached decisions yet.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A lack of regulatory oversight hasn’t stopped Zyn from becoming the latest product to lure people to a new and—at least seemingly—less-dangerous way to consume nicotine. “It’s a parallel world with what happened with e-cigarettes,” says Maciej Goniewicz, a nicotine and tobacco-control researcher at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in New York.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Still, Zyn is nowhere close to as ubiquitous as Juul once was, according to the most recent available data. About 4.5% of U.S. adults vaped and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">11.5% smoked in 2021</a>, but only about 2% used smokeless tobacco products. And just <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1.5% of U.S. teenagers regularly used nicotine pouches</a> in 2023. (For context, at the height of Juul’s popularity in 2019, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">27.5% of U.S. high schoolers vaped</a>.) “It’s not an apples-to-apples comparison,” says Corey Henry, director of U.S. communications at Zyn's parent company, Philip Morris International (PMI). “To be honest, it’s not even an apples-to-asteroids comparison.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But oral nicotine products have picked up significant traction in recent years. The Federal Trade Commission <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently reported</a> that the category’s U.S. sales doubled from $453 million in 2020 to more than $1 billion in 2022. And Zyn’s U.S. business grew by 62% from 2022 to 2023 alone, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an earnings report from PMI</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Zyn is also starting to go viral, which raises concerns about the product appealing to teens who might otherwise stay away from nicotine, says Dr. Robert Jackler, a tobacco advertising expert and professor emeritus at Stanford University. "The market for these pouches is rapidly growing, and it's being driven by many attributes that would be attractive to young people in the way e-cigarettes such as Juul were," Jackler says, including appealing flavors and advertising that makes users look attractive, active, and cool. “We’ve seen this playbook before,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s even a name for people who post about the pouches—<a href=#>Zynfluencers</a>—prompting concern from some public-health officials and lawmakers. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">called for a crackdown on products like Zyn</a>, warning parents that companies “lock their sights on young kids—teenagers, and even lower—and then use the social media to hook 'em.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Zyn does not hire influencers or use models younger than 35 in its ads, Henry says. It also bars anyone younger than 21 from accessing its website and flags social media<strong> </strong>posts that depict underage or dangerous use of Zyn to the platforms. But the company can't "police the internet," Henry says. Platforms including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok already prohibit</a> posts that show or encourage underage drug, alcohol, or tobacco use, yet Henry says these policies don't always catch everything.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Henry says PMI does everything required, and more, to prevent underage Zyn use. Its ads, he says, are meant to appeal to adult tobacco users looking to switch, not teenagers. The average Zyn user is 39 and previously used another tobacco or nicotine product, according to 2023 company research conducted among customers 21 and older.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Research on the safety of nicotine pouches is ongoing. But other oral products—including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">snus</a>, which is similar to Zyn but contains tobacco instead of just nicotine—have been studied for decades and seem to present significantly lower risks of cancer and other diseases, relative to cigarettes. In 2019, the FDA allowed some snus products to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">explicitly sold as lower-risk alternatives</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Based on what is currently known, Goniewicz, the nicotine researcher, says it’s safe to assume nicotine pouches don’t damage the lungs because users aren’t inhaling anything. Pouches also contain fewer of the cancer-causing chemicals found in traditional chewing tobacco, he says. Their biggest health risk for adult users, in his view, likely lies in nicotine’s potential to harm the cardiovascular system.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Products like these are also risky for oral health. “Anytime you park a foreign substance between your teeth and gums, you are taking a risk of dental problems,” such as cavities and gum disease, adds Jackler, who practiced for decades as an ear, nose, and throat physician.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some researchers have raised additional concerns. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One 2023 study</a> found that oral nicotine products like Zyn contain low levels of potentially harmful substances, including ammonia and formaldehyde. And in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a small 2024 study</a> of adults who use nicotine pouches, almost all of them reported some kind of unpleasant side effect, including mouth lesions, nausea, and a sore throat or mouth. “They certainly seem to be safer than tobacco cigarettes,” says study co-author Ashley Dowd, a postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins University. “But having a general sense that they’re safe would concern me"—especially, she says, if it prompts people who don't currently use nicotine to pick up a pouch thinking it's harmless.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dowd’s study also found that most pouch users continued to smoke or vape on the side. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Another 2023 study</a> found the same thing among users ages 15 to 24. Those findings suggest that some users can’t or don’t want to completely switch from smoking to using pouches—perhaps because they don’t deliver nicotine to the bloodstream rapidly enough to quell cravings, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some recent research</a> hints. Using multiple nicotine products is concerning, Jackler says, since it can “deepen addiction and make continuing smoking more likely.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But if people were to entirely quit cigarettes or vapes in favor of pouches, “as a physician, I would welcome that,” Jackler says. “On the other hand, I wish they never got addicted to begin with.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Correction, March 4</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The original version of this story misstated when 1.5% of teenagers reported using nicotine pouches. That estimate is from 2023, not 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcGNrfnqBjrOwp2WenrCwwMinnGaon6qwqbHSZqeoqKWhrrO107Jm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzyn-nicotine-pouches-popularity.html&text=Zyn%20Nicotine%20Pouches%20Are%20Taking%20Off&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzyn-nicotine-pouches-popularity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzyn-nicotine-pouches-popularity.html&title=Zyn%20Nicotine%20Pouches%20Are%20Taking%20Off" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzyn-nicotine-pouches-popularity.html&title=Zyn%20Nicotine%20Pouches%20Are%20Taking%20Off" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzyn-nicotine-pouches-popularity.html&title=Zyn%20Nicotine%20Pouches%20Are%20Taking%20Off" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzyn-nicotine-pouches-popularity.html&description=Zyn%20Nicotine%20Pouches%20Are%20Taking%20Off" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1583593-dwarfs-names-snow-white-personalities-fun-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="7 dwarfs' names from Snow White, their personalities and fun facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-causes-strawberry-legs-and-how-to-get-rid-of-it-798580.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Causes Strawberry Legs and How to Get Rid of It">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
