When he was only six years old, his parents' marriage failed, so they got divorced. He was thus raised by his mother and grandmother at the Bankhead Courts housing scheme for three years. He later moved in with his father, who is a gospel singer in Austell, Georgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/718bd41c147144ef.jpg><p class=align-left>Initially, Hill was reluctant about moving in with his father. However, he later admitted that making this decision saved his life because it prevented him from engaging with, and joining the wrong company. When he was about 13 years old, he spent plenty of time on the internet. That was the time where internet memes started becoming a form of entertainment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0904f61708ead7d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>600Breezy biography: age, height, real name, kids, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During his teenage years, Hill would often spend time alone. He kept himself occupied on the internet. He created memes using his enchanting wit and his shrewdness in the pop-culture. The rapper started playing the trumpet when he was in fourth grade. He was in the first chair by the time he was in junior high, but he stopped playing because he was afraid of looking uncool among his peers.</p><p class=align-left>The rapper went to Lithia Springs High School. He graduated from this institution in 2017. He then joined the University of West Georgia for one year. He dropped out of campus and opted to live with his sister. He worked at Six Flags Over Georgia and Zaxby's to earn a living.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/595dac521f30271a.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Before becoming a famous rapper and singer, Hill started his career as an internet personality. His career timeline is as follows;</p><h3>Internet personality</h3><p class=align-left>Between 2015 and 2017, Nas X invested a lot of time in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">becoming an online star</a>. He isolated himself from his peers when they were outside class in his teenage years. At the time, he dreamed of becoming an online star by attracting a massive following on social media. He started by doing comedy videos on Facebook. Later, he moved to Instagram and then Twitter. Soon, he was a master on Twitter, and his content would often go viral.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/784953cadf8c4b2b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ashley Purdy bio: age, height, girlfriend, why did he leave BVB?</span></p></a><h3>Music career</h3><p class=align-left>As he was still pursuing his online comedy, Nas X also wrote songs. He would often write and record his songs in the closet. Soon, he found his footing in the music industry. On the 3rd of December 2018, he released his debut song with the title, <i>Old Town Road</i>, which is a country rap song.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0904f61708ead7d3.jpg><p class=align-left><i>Old Town Road</i> used a beat from YoungKio's online store. The Dutch producer sold the beat to the rapper for only $30. The rapper created and sent out memes on social media to promote his song. He reportedly created about one hundred memes, and the song went viral at the beginning of 2019.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The <i>#Yeehaw Challenge</i></a> that he created contributed to the success of his song. Many of his fans participated in the challenge by dressing either as a cowgirl or wrangler. They used <i>Old Town Road</i> as the soundtrack for the challenge. <i>Old Town Road </i>is a song that is repetitive and easy to sing along to. It is, therefore, not surprising that children and adults could easily relate to the lyrics which are about horse and tractor riding.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4880a3778b657987.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating story of John Krasinski: what is "The Office" star up to?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The impressive performance of the song made Nas X a sought-after artist. Many record labels wanted him to join their brand. After a strong bidding game from different labels, the rapper entered into a recording contract with Columbia Records. The contract began in March 2019.</p><p class=align-left>One of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">country stars who supported</a><i>Old Town Road</i> is Billy Ray Cyrus. In April 2019, a remix of the song was done by the rapper, and Billy Ray Cyrus featured as a vocalist. Several other remixes of the song have been done so far. The video for <i>Old Town Road</i> was released in August 2019, and it has been received with love and support from the fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4bbf6b4900ae3ee5.jpg><p class=align-left>After being signed with Columbia Records, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nas X released<i> 7</i></a>, his debut EP on the 21st of June 2019.

He performed at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">annual Glastonbury Festival</a> in the United Kingdom. He and Billy joined Billy's daughter, Miley Cyrus, on stage for the song, <i>Old Town Road</i>.

The viral song also ranked 19th on the Hot Country Songs and 36th on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs list.</p><p class=align-left>Although the song ranked high in different charts, it was removed from Hot Country chart in March 2019. Billboard reported that the decision to remove the song was made because the song failed to embrace adequate elements of the modern country music. Instead, it only has cowboy and country imagery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/784953cadf8c4b2b.jpg><p class=align-left>Some people argued that the song was removed from the Hot Country chart because the singer is black.

A few days later, Panini Lil Nas X appeared on BBC Breakfast. He publicly stated that he was a gay man who understood that his sexual orientation is yet to be fully and readily accepted in the rap and country music communities.</p><p class=align-left>When Lil Nas gay news spread, he received loving and supportive messages as well as severe backlash from different people.
