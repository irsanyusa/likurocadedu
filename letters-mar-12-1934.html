He runs with natural ability a job not of his own choosing, which your Brain Trust would bungle in a day. Stretch every American’s brain far enough to grasp that the monarchy is a different thing from the man who is King, and that British royalist sentiment has little to do with the blah-haw-haw which selected Englishmen, usually pabliticians, spill through the cigar smoke at Hands-Across-the-Sea dinners.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Quite sincerely, when you are rude to the present occupant of the Throne, you touch the kind old daddy, not of the aristocracy, but of millions of impoverished, overtaxed Englishmen in the middle classes who see in the King’s outlook on life one of the few remaining pieces of sentiment they can still permit themselves.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">G.

When one reflects just how vital a thing language is, one realizes that, after all, this is serious.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dr. McClenahan’s attitude with regard to English grammar is the type of blinded, presumptuous pedagogism that should not be tolerated in a Board of Education [TIME, Feb. 26]. For his “purism” the Doctor can doubtless cite any number of authorities—except the language self.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Correct English” is an unrealistic, pedantic legend, and the quicker we get rid of it, the better. For authorities I refer the Doctor to any elementary course in linguistic science, and to Dr. Edward Sapir, [Sterling professor] of the Yale University Department of Anthropology and Linguistics and head of a committee to bring out a New English Grammar to describe the language as it really is instead of for harassing school children with artificial, pseudo-classical prescriptions and “rules”—or to anybody who has at least an inkling of the true nature of language and its principles.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The split infinitive is a natural English locution found in the best writers (e. g.. Byron, Carlyle, Browning). Greek used singular verbs with neuter plural subjects: the English tendency to do the opposite is caused by psychological and linguistic forces whose subtlety and complexity Dr. McClenahan probably never dreamed of, and an arbitrary interpretation of which even a trained linguistic scientist might hesitate to attempt.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It is time language was dealt with with a little more scientific reverence and a little less insolent pedanticism.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">G.

It was the occasion of the installation of a Sigma Nu Fraternity chapter at Duke.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Early in the banquet a rat, the size of a young kitten, appeared from under a radiator and Dr. Few, arising to the occasion, attempted to fight the rodent with a tray stand, finally felling the rat with the well-placed heel of his patent leather shoe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the course of the toasts the charter for the new chapter was presented, after which, as toastmaster, I presented Dean Wannamaker, who opened his remarks by suggesting that “no one could say the charter had not been properly ratified.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His sense of humor is traditional at Duke.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">CHARLES EDWARD THOMAS Indianapolis, Ind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wellman’s Kitten</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Your report regarding the passing of Walter Wellman is accurate enough, as far as it goes, except for the statement that a wireless message was sent from the America saying the kitten had jumped overboard and was rescued by means of a rope [TIME, Feb. 12]. No such message was sent. I should know, because I was Wellman’s wireless operator.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a matter of fact, the cat did not jump overboard. When we took off the kitten acted very queerly and we attempted to put it aboard a yacht by means of an empty canvas ballast sack and a long line. However, as we drifted over shoal water, this attempt was abandoned and the kitten went along with us. He settled down after this incident.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You are also inaccurate in stating that only four messages were sent from the dirigible by wireless. I cannot remember the exact number now, but numerous messages were sent to the shore stations at Atlantic City and Siasconset, Mass. At least a dozen more were sent to the steamer Trent, while she was following us prior to picking up our crew.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As far as I know, you are correct in stating that the America was the first airship to communicate with the ground by radio and, I believe, the writer was the first air-going wireless operator. The equipment used was a very crude affair, compared with modern radio equipment, but served its purpose, being very useful in effecting our rescue. This set was built in England and was admitted into the U. S. under bond. After our return it was shipped back to England and thus was lost a very interesting museum piece. However, during the War I saw the key of this set in the basement of the great radio station at Arlington, Va. I do not know how it came to be held out.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JOHN R.

Your colored reporting on the Morgan testimony was revolting. Your effort to work up sympathy for an old —* rolling in money who was too blind and grasping to contribute toward the expenses of the very government which was trying to prevent his kind from being exterminated was disgusting, and unfortunately there are more counts against you of the same nature.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Really, it is all very puzzling—you men must be in your daily life honest, intelligent and educated or you would not be where you are, but having in your hands an instrument of publicity reaching thousands of readers you drop your principles and resort to sneaking actions which you would scorn in your private life. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another thing, small but telling—in several recent issues you have run an advertisement from Heinz under the topical head “Victuals” which in no way is distinguished from the news text.

He had an obligation to determine his financial responsibility in advance. When he placed Mr. Thomas’ recital in the local manager’s charge (and note that Mr. Wagner used the term “local manager”) he took upon himself a responsibility to the artist’s patrons that he and the artist could not escape. The prestige of the artist secured the subscriptions of the patrons, not the reputation nor the ability of the local manager.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mr. Wagner places the fee of the artist before the responsibility of himself and of the artist to the public. Both Mr. Wagner and Mr. Thomas are placed in the position where they can protect themselves; the generous public who support both but which cannot safeguard its interests is left out of consideration.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mr. Wagner had a cause for civil action against the local manager if the fee were not paid as per contract. He could have demanded cash in advance or the filing of a bond for the payment of the fee. He did neither. Mr. Thomas’ patrons suffered discomfort, inconvenience and perhaps financial loss through no fault of their own. Custom, in the forming of which the public has no voice, cannot absolve the artist nor his manager from responsibility.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">THOMAS F.
