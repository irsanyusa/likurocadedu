Season 7 has not yet been officially announced by Fox. After last night’s reveal of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyga as Dalmatian</a>, Cannon pointed out that everyone thought Nelly was under the mask.</strong> <strong>Cannon shared on his talk show, Nick Cannon, that the rapper would be a great future contestant on the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-executive-producer-nick-cannon-loves-the-shock-factor-on-the-masked-singer>Executive Producer Nick Cannon Loves the Shock Factor on ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>Cannon started off his show by playing a clip from Tyga’s reveal on The Masked Singer. The judges speculated whether or not Nelly was under the mask. The fact that Cannon is an executive producer of the show may come as a shock to some. Most have only known him as the host of the franchise since the very first season. So many of his famous friends have competed and he can usually tell who they are before they are unmasked. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 6</a> reveals have been no exception.</p><p>“They keep it a secret from me even though I’m the executive producer of the show,” Cannon said. “I want to play the game with everybody so I’m like I don’t want to know who’s in the costume because somebody like Tyga, like last night, as soon as I heard his voice I was like ‘Oh that’s Tyga.'”</p><p>Obviously, we have so many questions about Cannon’s executive producer role. Even though he said on air that he is not told who the contestants are, there’s probably a list of his buddies that he wants to recruit for the show. Many of the contestants from all of the seasons have appeared on his show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wild&nbsp;‘N Out</a>. It probably isn’t a coincidence that he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">knows most contestants’ identities</a> just by their body language, Tyga included.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cannon-hopes-to-get-his-good-friend-on-the-next-season>Cannon Hopes To Get His Good Friend on the Next Season</h2><p>Nelly is a talented three-time Grammy winner. He is best known for being one of the first rappers to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>bridge the gap</a> between country music and rap. He’s had several successful collaborations with Florida Georgia Line and Kane Brown. Before bringing Nelly on his talk show, Cannon shared his hopes for casting the next season of The Masked Singer.</p><p>“Because I’m in the industry, I know my friends and stuff,” Cannon said. “I can hear their voices but I still like to be surprised and shocked just like everyone else. So, I’m going to talk to see if I can convince Mr. Country Grammar Nelly to be on the show because I think it’s amazing. He got a platinum album out now.”</p><p>Nelly did compete on Season 29 of Dancing with the Stars last year. It is common for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">contestants</a> from that show to come to compete on The Masked Singer. This is not such a far-fetched idea on Cannon’s part, but he did ruin the element of surprise. Expect to see Nelly on The Masked Singer at some point in the future.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dwight-howard-shares-his-experience-as-octopus>Dwight Howard Shares His Experience as Octopus</h2><p>NBA champion Dwight Howard stopped by to talk about his experience competing on Season 6 of The Masked Singer. Cannon and Howard used to be neighbors the first time he was on the Los Angeles Lakers. Howard’s mom would come over to Cannon’s house all of the time. He was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unmasked as Octopus</a> during The Masked Singer’s double elimination.</p><p>“Thank you for helping me make her dream come true,” Howard said. “The Masked Singer, that’s her favorite show. Since then, she has been on cloud nine. I’m so happy for mom.”</p><p>Cannon knew Howard was under the costume because of how tall he is. He joked that it either had to be Howard as Octopus or Shaquille&nbsp;O’Neal. The entire experience has made Howard want to continue to sing. Cannon invited Howard to come to Harlem to sing on Nick Cannon any time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/yOOzpwFn6Tc</p></figure><p>“I’m very thankful and grateful for that opportunity,” Howard said. “Being on The Masked Singer really kind of gave me more confidence. I felt like a real entertainer and I was like, man let me take my mask off and be Dwight all of the time, but Octopus brought it out of me.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1209161959.jpeg alt="The Jonas Brothers Serve Looks in “Who’s in Your Head” Video" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapGWTlruvu81moKxlkaG%2Fpq3DsmSesZWeu6h5z5qjZqaVobm6edOoZKOnmaN6r7HXrWSsnZGovK95zp9kraCVYrqiv8qem2armaO0pr6O</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnick-cannon-is-already-eyeing-pal-nelly-to-join-next-season-of-the-masked-singer.html&text=Nick%20Cannon%20is%20Already%20Eyeing%20Pal%20Nelly%20to%20Join%20Next%20Season%20of%20%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-cannon-is-already-eyeing-pal-nelly-to-join-next-season-of-the-masked-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-cannon-is-already-eyeing-pal-nelly-to-join-next-season-of-the-masked-singer.html&title=Nick%20Cannon%20is%20Already%20Eyeing%20Pal%20Nelly%20to%20Join%20Next%20Season%20of%20%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnick-cannon-is-already-eyeing-pal-nelly-to-join-next-season-of-the-masked-singer.html&title=Nick%20Cannon%20is%20Already%20Eyeing%20Pal%20Nelly%20to%20Join%20Next%20Season%20of%20%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnick-cannon-is-already-eyeing-pal-nelly-to-join-next-season-of-the-masked-singer.html&title=Nick%20Cannon%20is%20Already%20Eyeing%20Pal%20Nelly%20to%20Join%20Next%20Season%20of%20%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-cannon-is-already-eyeing-pal-nelly-to-join-next-season-of-the-masked-singer.html&description=Nick%20Cannon%20is%20Already%20Eyeing%20Pal%20Nelly%20to%20Join%20Next%20Season%20of%20%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./8-movie-stars-who-put-art-first-and-drastically-changed-their-look-for-a-role-810677.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Movie Stars Who Put Art First and Drastically Changed Their Look for a Role">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bio-certaines-regions-sactivent-pour-soutenir-la-filiere-en-difficulte.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="les initiatives des rgions pour soutenir la filire en difficult">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
