His city, Reykjavik in 1918, is homogeneous and isolated and seems entirely defenceless against the Spanish flu, which has already torn through Europe, Asia, and North America and is now lapping up on Iceland's shores.</p><p>"The story of a young man on the fringes of a society that is itself at the fringes of the world — at what seems like history's most tumultuous, perhaps ultimate moment."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly" by Sun-Mi Hwang, translated by Victoria Cribb — 3.71 stars</p><p>"This is the story of a hen named Sprout. No longer content to lay eggs on command, only to have them carted off to the market, she glimpses her future every morning through the barn doors, where the other animals roam free, and comes up with a plan to escape into the wild — and to hatch an egg of her own.</p><p>"An anthem for freedom, individuality, and motherhood featuring a plucky, spirited heroine who rebels against the tradition-bound world of the barnyard, 'The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly' is a novel of universal resonance that also opens a window on Korea, where it has captivated millions of readers."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Goodbye, Vitamin" by Rachel Khong — 3.72 stars</p><p>"'Goodbye, Vitamin' is the wry, beautifully observed story of a woman at a crossroads, as Ruth and her friends attempt to shore up her father's career.</p><p>"She and her mother obsess over the ambiguous health benefits — in the absence of a cure — of dried jellyfish supplements and vitamin pills; and they all try to forge a new relationship with the brilliant, childlike, irascible man her father has become."</p><p>"Dept. of Speculation" by Jenny Offill — 3.72 stars</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Jenny Offill's heroine, referred to in these pages as simply 'the wife,' once exchanged love letters with her husband postmarked Dept. of Speculation, their code name for all the uncertainty that inheres in life and in the strangely fluid confines of a long relationship.</p><p>"As they confront an array of common catastrophes — a colicky baby, a faltering marriage, stalled ambitions — the wife analyzes her predicament.</p><p>"She muses on the consuming, capacious experience of maternal love, and the near total destruction of the self that ensues from it as she confronts the friction between domestic life and the seductions and demands of art."</p><p>"This is How You Lose Her" by Junot Díaz — 3.75 stars</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"On a beach in the Dominican Republic, a doomed relationship flounders.

They embark on a furtive love affair and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city.</p><p>"When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors — doors that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price."</p><p>"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" by Mark Haddon — 3.85 stars</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched.</p><p>"Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, Christopher is autistic. Everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. Routine, order and predictability shelter him from the messy, wider world."</p><p>"Another Brooklyn" by Jacqueline Woodson — 3.87 stars</p><p>"For August and her girls, sharing confidences as they ambled through neighbourhood streets, Brooklyn was a place where they believed that they were beautiful, talented, brilliant — a part of a future that belonged to them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But beneath the hopeful veneer, there was another Brooklyn, a dangerous place where grown men reached for innocent girls in dark hallways, where ghosts haunted the night, where mothers disappeared."</p><p>"Gwendy's Button Box" by Stephen King and Richard T. Chizmar — 3.9 stars</p><p>"There are three ways up to Castle View from the town of Castle Rock: Route 117, Pleasant Road, and the Suicide Stairs.

On his head is a small neat black hat. The time will come when Gwendy has nightmares about that hat."</p><p>"Our Souls at Night" by Kent Haruf — 3.96 stars</p><p>"In the familiar setting of Holt, Colorado, home to all of Kent Haruf's inimitable fiction, Addie Moore pays an unexpected visit to a neighbour, Louis Waters. Her husband died years ago, as did his wife, and in such a small town they naturally have known of each other for decades; in fact, Addie was quite fond of Louis's wife.</p><p>"His daughter lives hours away in Colorado Springs, her son even farther away in Grand Junction, and Addie and Louis have long been living alone in houses now empty of family, the nights so terribly lonely, especially with no one to talk with."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"The Ocean at the End of the Lane" by Neil Gaiman — 3.99 stars</p><p>"Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother.</p><p>"He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"The Course of Love" by Alain de Botton — 4.02 stars</p><p>"In Edinburgh, a couple, Rabih and Kirsten, fall in love. They get married, they have children — but no long-term relationship is as simple as 'happily ever after.'</p><p>"'The Course of Love' is a novel that explores what happens after the birth of love, what it takes to maintain love, and what happens to our original ideals under the pressures of an average existence"</p><p>"The Remains of the Day" by Kazuo Ishiguro — 4.1 stars</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"In the summer of 1956, Stevens, a long-serving butler at Darlington Hall, decides to take a motoring trip through the West Country.</p><p>"The six-day excursion becomes a journey into the past of Stevens and England, a past that takes in fascism, two world wars, and an unrealised love between the butler and his housekeeper."</p><p>"News of the World" by Paulette Jiles — 4.13 stars</p><p>"In the aftermath of the American Civil War, an ageing itinerant news reader agrees to transport a young captive of the Kiowa back to her people in this morally complex, multi-layered novel of historical fiction that explores the boundaries of family, responsibility, honour, and trust."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"A Monster Calls" by Patrick Ness, illustrated by Jim Kay — 4.37 stars</p><p>"At seven minutes past midnight, thirteen-year-old Conor wakes to find a monster outside his bedroom window. But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting — he's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments.</p><p>"The monster in his backyard is different.
