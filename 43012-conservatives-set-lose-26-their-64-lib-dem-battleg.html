None would be retained with a majority of over 20 points.</p><p>Although constituencies would fall to the Liberal Democrats all across the country, including Harrogate and Knaresborough in the North and South Cambridgeshire in the East, perhaps the most striking losses come in the South West, where we estimate that the Conservative vote share is down by over 16 points on 2019.</p><p>Here, of the 20 constituencies included in the definition, eight would go to the Liberal Democrats. That includes the Conservative "Celtic Fringe" seats, <a href=#>identified by YouGov earlier this month</a>, of Wells, North Cornwall, St Ives, North Devon, and Taunton Deane.</p><p>Elsewhere, many <a href=#>Blue Wall seats</a> would also fall to Liberal Democrat challengers. As well as the aforementioned seats of Esher and Walton and Surrey South West, other commuter-belt constituencies such as Guildford, Woking, Hitchin and Harpenden, and Wokingham would also be lost. We estimate that nine of the 29 battleground seats in the South East region would go from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats, if an election were being held now.</p><p>Across each of the three parties there are interesting geographical variations to vote share change among the constituencies analysed. For instance, while the Liberal Democrats are up by eight points in battleground seats in the South East, and nine points in the South West, they are actually down in London by one point.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives are down 15 and 16 points in the South West and South East respectively, 14 points in the East of England, the North and the Midlands, and 11 in London.</p><p>The only Con-Lib Dem battlegrounds region where Labour have increased their vote share on 2019 is in London, where they are up by three points. In all other regions their vote share in these battleground seats is down – despite Labour’s vote intention being around six to nine points higher than the 32% they managed at the last election.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Lib20Dem20Con20battlegrounds20regional20MRP.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Notes</h3><p>YouGov interviewed 13,459 voters across England between 15-29 June for this research. Constituency-level forecasts were estimated using the same method which correctly predicted the 2017 and 2019 general elections, with an additional tactical voting model (see below). MRP constituency forecast models first estimate the relationship between a wide variety of characteristics about prospective voters and their vote intention (this is the ‘multilevel model’ part). It then uses data at the constituency level to predict the outcomes of seats based on the concentration of various different types of voters who live there, according to what the multilevel model says about their probability of voting for various parties (‘post-stratification’). In this instance, 1,000 draws from the posterior distribution of the multilevel model were used to predict the constituency probabilities, which ran for 12,000 post-warmup iterations across four chains.</p><p>Turnout likelihood for each voter group was estimated using a multilevel model fit on British Election Study data with post-hoc adjustments made according to the latest self-reported turnout likelihoods in YouGov data. The precise multilevel model equation has been benchmarked to correctly estimate the 2017 and 2019 General Elections to within a handful of seats of each party’s actual performance in those elections.</p><p>Our latest MRP model differs from others released in the past year in two important ways. Firstly, we made use of our traditional MRP election model vote intention question which asks respondents how they would vote in their constituency. Secondly, we included a tactical voting model which assumed that varying fractional degrees of the kind of pro-Lib Dem tactical voting we have seen in recent by-election and local elections would happen again in these battlegrounds, depending on how obviously the Lib Dems were best placed to challenge Conservative incumbents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGh9cn6MnKanq5Wnw6LAyK%2BcrGWjmsFuuM6snGZqZmLBqbHIq2RvbF2htqN5w56kZpqRqcGtscY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f43012-conservatives-set-lose-26-their-64-lib-dem-battleg.html&text=Conservatives%20set%20to%20lose%2026%20of%20their%2064%20Lib%20Dem%20battleground%20seats&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f43012-conservatives-set-lose-26-their-64-lib-dem-battleg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f43012-conservatives-set-lose-26-their-64-lib-dem-battleg.html&title=Conservatives%20set%20to%20lose%2026%20of%20their%2064%20Lib%20Dem%20battleground%20seats" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f43012-conservatives-set-lose-26-their-64-lib-dem-battleg.html&title=Conservatives%20set%20to%20lose%2026%20of%20their%2064%20Lib%20Dem%20battleground%20seats" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f43012-conservatives-set-lose-26-their-64-lib-dem-battleg.html&title=Conservatives%20set%20to%20lose%2026%20of%20their%2064%20Lib%20Dem%20battleground%20seats" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f43012-conservatives-set-lose-26-their-64-lib-dem-battleg.html&description=Conservatives%20set%20to%20lose%2026%20of%20their%2064%20Lib%20Dem%20battleground%20seats" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./coroner-attributes-sylvester-oromonis-death-to-his-parents-negligence.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Coroner attributes Sylvester Oromonis death to his parents' negligence">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1213030-bible-verses-children-duties-parents-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bible verses about children and their duties to parents">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
