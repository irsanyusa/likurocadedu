People believed that cats possessed magical qualities and brought good luck. Although cats were not directly involved in formal animal-worshipping rituals, they were highly valued as companions.</p><p>Owning a cat was believed to bring fortune and good health to households. People even went as far as dressing their feline friends in fancy clothes and sometimes adorning them with jewels.</p><p>Cats also had a strong presence in ancient Egyptian mythology. Many gods and goddesses were depicted with cat heads, representing power and wealth. Among these deities was the goddess Bastet, also known as Bast. Bastet was portrayed as a goddess with the body of a woman and the head of a cat, often wearing a single gold earring. She was revered as a protective deity associated with joy and fertility.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>Snakes in North America</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-f3595972-1713-42c5-ad97-df7473661f24 data-caption="Snakes are revered in North America [Pinterest]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/lJ9ktkpTURBXy9mYjNhNzdjMzc0OWU4ZDMwMTk3NmFmMDE0ZDNhMmI5Ny5qcGeRlQLNAjTNAvDCww></span><p>In Native American mythology, snakes have been revered, particularly among the Aztecs. One of their prominent deities, Quetzalcoatl, was depicted as a feathered serpent, combining the characteristics of a bird and a rattlesnake. In ancient folktales, this deity was often portrayed devouring humans.</p><p>Native Americans perceived snakes as sacred animals for various reasons. They symbolised fertility and were associated with the idea of rebirth due to their ability to shed their skin. Interestingly, the concept of snakes as sacred animals originated in ancient India and later influenced the Aztecs and other Native American cultures.</p><p>Today, the Hopi people of North America continue to honour snakes through their traditional snake dances. These ceremonies unite the spirits of two serpents and renew the fertility of nature.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>Goats in Syria</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-80d29515-2e28-4c29-b26e-5693a64e3e0e data-caption="The Damascus goats of Syria [Pinterest]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/GYwktkpTURBXy85ZGIzZDlmMzM4OGFmODg0YzBlYTE0N2VkMmQwOGNjNi5qcGeRlQLNAjTNAWPCww></span><p>The Damascus goats particularly are revered by the Syrians.

They are highly respected and valued as one of the most important animals in the world when it comes to animal worship. According to Indian beliefs, cows are seen as a source of goodness. The milk they produce is beneficial for all creatures, symbolising the nurturing qualities of Mother Earth.</p><p>In Indian folklore and mythology, the deity named Krishna spent his life taking care of cows. While Hindus don't worship cows directly, they consider them holy and hold them in high regard. This means that they don't use cow meat for food as many other cultures do.</p><p>Indians have always seen cows as sacred animals and hold them in high regard.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-24>Tigers in Korea</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6f906b44-7670-4f8a-b3f7-2cf09742b40d data-caption="Tigers are rvered in South Korea [Pinterest]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/JSJktkpTURBXy81YTc2ODc0OTNkM2VhN2EyZDIzYWUxNTE0Y2E5YmJiNS5qcGeRlQLNAjPNAXLCww></span><p>In South Korea, tigers are highly revered.
