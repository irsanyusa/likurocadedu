She also attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and received her higher education there. Her first television appearance was on <i>"Mrs. Eastwood & Company"</i>, the show where she portrayed herself. It premiered in May 2012 and followed the lives of her, her stepmother Dina, and half-sister Morgan.</p><p class=align-left>The girl got into a slight controversy during her time on the show. One of the early episodes showed her and her former boyfriend Tyler Shields, who is a photographer, destroying an expensive bag during a photoshoot. The Hermes Birkin bag cost $100,000. This generated a lot of negative attention around the well-known actor's daughter, even though she later excused herself by saying that people spend money on creating things.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9277a6feaa10d015.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rachel Reynolds bio: age, height, measurements, salary, net worth</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/171d4f653bd721d7.jpg><p class=align-left>In 2013, she was Miss Golden Globe - her responsibilities were to assist with the ceremony, hand out awards and escort guests.</p><p class=align-left>The famous heiress runs an Instagram, where she frequently posts selfies, pictures from her vacations, and sweet photos with her family and son.
