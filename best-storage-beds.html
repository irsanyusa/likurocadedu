Even the <a rel=alternate href=#>best sectional sofas</a> if you tend to clonk out on the couch. It’s crucial to create a room in which to retreat from the world and forget about problems while basking in a carefully cultivated order where everything has its place.</p><p>Unless, of course, like me, your bedroom is one of those with a woefully tiny closet and significant lack of storage space. In that case, you may feel as if your belongings are preventing you from achieving an optimal level of Zen, or even any level of Zen.</p><p>I live in a pre-war apartment in New York City with minimal closet space. While I do have two bedrooms, they are both quite small with room for a queen-sized bed, but not much else (the smaller room doesn’t even accommodate a normal sized dresser) which wouldn’t necessarily be a problem, but the rest of the apartment is equally remiss in providing any place to store clothing or linens. I could use the ‘bins under the bed’ approach, but I've never particularly liked that as things always seem to get jumbled up and unless you use a long dust ruffle, you can see them.</p><p>Thankfully, storage beds exist, which solves all of these issues while being both stylish and practical. These include beds with drawers or cubbies, as well as lift up mattresses or head boards outfitted with shelves. Storage beds usually cost more than regular beds, but they do mean you can probably forego buying a dresser. They come in a variety of styles, colors, and finishes to complement a range of design styles. Here are some of the best options available.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-storage-beds>What to consider when buying storage beds</h2><h3>Size</h3><p>This is perhaps the most important. Not only do you need to make sure the bed will fit in your space, but remember to take into account that you need ample room to pull the drawers out – and that many storage beds have them on two (or even three) sides. If your bed of choice has a headboard with shelves, it’s going to take up more space than a regular bed of the same size. As my dad always used to say, “measure your space, then measure again.”</p><h3>Storage type</h3><p>The three main types of storage beds are those with cubbies or drawers on the bottom, pop-ups (where the mattress lifts up), and those with an integrated headboard shelf space. Which option is best for you depends on personal preference, but those with underbed storage in the form of drawers tend to be best for people who want to expand their everyday closet space. L while lift up beds are ideal for providing a space for things you won’t need to access on a regular basis.</p><h3>Material</h3><p>Storage beds come in a range of materials: upholstered ones made with linen, velvet, or microfiber, as well as various wood finishes. Beds constructed from solid wood will be sturdier than those made from MDF or engineered wood, though they will also be heavier. Which, in a bed, is a decidedly good thing.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-storage-beds>Our top picks for the best storage beds</h2><h3>Best budget storage bed: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Upholstered Platform Storage Bed with Classic Headboard and Four Drawers</a></h3><p>This upholstered bed is comfortably under $500 and comes complete with button tufted head and footboards, offering a budget minded option that doesn’t skimp on storage space.

I took into consideration materials used, as well as functionality, sturdiness, and aesthetic properties (nobody wants an ugly bed no matter how practical it may be). I also tried to include options that would satisfy a range of sensibilities and styles. Many of the ones I included I’ve tested out in showrooms throughout New York City while shopping for my perfect storage bed solution.</p><p>The two I ended up buying after extensive angst and waffling were the West Elm Mid-Century Headboard Storage bed because I adore mid-century modern furniture and The Design Within Reach Matera bed because of its small footprint and simple lines (in a small room, anything too fussy looks overbearing to me).</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What should you not keep in bed storage?</h3><p>Lift up storage beds are best for things that you won’t need to access on a daily or weekly basis such as seasonal clothing, extra blankets and pillows, or even holiday decorations. Beds with drawers can be used just as you would a dresser or wardrobe. That said, there are some things that aren’t ideal to stow under the bed: Anything breakable, important documents (which can be susceptible to light and air), and anything flammable (nail polish, perfumes, etc.).</p><h3>Does a storage bed need a box spring?</h3><p>In most instances, no. The majority of storage beds work similar to a platform bed base, whether that be wood slats or a solid base. I like a higher height to my bed (perhaps a throwback to childhood games of deadly crocodiles or alligators), so I use a boxspring. If you are going to add a box spring, keep in mind the overall height of the head and foot boards to ensure the end proportions are aesthetically pleasing to you.</p><h3>How can I make my storage under my bed look nice?</h3><p>If your storage bed features open shelves or cubbies, consider decorative bins, boxes, or baskets to organize and contain your possessions.</p><h3>Are storage beds less supportive than other beds?</h3><p>Absolutely not. They come with the same kinds of slats and supports as traditional beds. If you switch to a storage bed, you’ll likely not even notice a difference. Unless, of course, you change your mattress, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lo6m8s63GnmSbnZSofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-storage-beds.html&text=Best%20Storage%20Beds%20for%20Stylishly%20Maximizing%20Space%20in%20Your%20Bedroom&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-storage-beds.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-storage-beds.html&title=Best%20Storage%20Beds%20for%20Stylishly%20Maximizing%20Space%20in%20Your%20Bedroom" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-storage-beds.html&title=Best%20Storage%20Beds%20for%20Stylishly%20Maximizing%20Space%20in%20Your%20Bedroom" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-storage-beds.html&title=Best%20Storage%20Beds%20for%20Stylishly%20Maximizing%20Space%20in%20Your%20Bedroom" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-storage-beds.html&description=Best%20Storage%20Beds%20for%20Stylishly%20Maximizing%20Space%20in%20Your%20Bedroom" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1150798-effect-lime-womb-good-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Effect of lime on womb: Side effects and health benefits">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./les-droits-et-libertes-dans-la-societe-numerique-en-discussion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Les droits et liberts dans la socit numrique en discussion">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
